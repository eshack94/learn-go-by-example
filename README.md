# Learn Go By Example

> NOTE: This repository is a work-in-progress, and will be continually updated 
> throughout my adventure in learning the Go programming language.

This repository serves as a personal dumping ground for Go-related notes and 
examples as I learn how to program in Go. Much of this repository consists of 
modified examples taken from Mark McGranaghan's [gobyexample](https://gobyexample.com) 
website, combined with additional notes, references, and examples that I have 
added to help digest the material.

Additional references and resources include [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org), 
[The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/), and various blog posts and tutorials 
I've located throughout the interwebs. Where possible, I've included references 
to these additional resources as headers in the form of a comment within the files 
that they are applicable to.

Feel free to fork this repository or submit PRs with additional examples/notes.
